Homebase Infrastructure Team Terraform Exercise
---

# Description
This is the terraform repository for our ECS infrastucture. The clsuter itself, and all resources required to run it are defined in this repository.

All new services, and their respective resources will also be added here.

# Instructions
As part of this exercise, you will be working on a pull-request that adds a new service to the cluster.
A pull-request has already been created and you will be conducting a code review on it.

You should draw upon your experience in creating secure, reliable, monitorable, and maintainable infrastructure. 

Good `git` etiquette is also important.

There are no gotchas!

## Code Review
Assume that this is a production environment. The service will be used by thousands of users and will be subject to high availability and uptime SLAs.
* Add resources, variables, or outputs that you think are necessary for security, observability, and availability.
* Be as descriptive as you'd like with your comments. Collaboration is the name of the game.
* Don't be afraid to ask for reasoning behind decisions made in the PR, or provide alternatives when appropriate.
